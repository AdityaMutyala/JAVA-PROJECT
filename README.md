# ⚙️ Java Mini Projects Collection

A set of simple Java mini-projects built to practice core concepts like **JavaFX UI**, **DSA logic**, **File handling**, and **MySQL database integration**. These aren't full-scale apps — just clean, functional demos that show how to wire logic with real tools.

## 💻 Included Projects

### 🧮 DSA Expression Calculator (Console)
- Parses and evaluates infix math expressions  
- Handles multiple errors interactively (e.g., divide-by-zero, unmatched brackets)  
- Offers result representation using **ArrayList**, **LinkedList**, or **Queue**  
- Tracks and prints even/odd numbers separately

### 🖥️ JavaFX + JDBC Dynamic Table Manager
- GUI-based CRUD app using **JavaFX** and **MySQL JDBC**  
- Create, insert, update, truncate, or drop tables dynamically  
- Dark-themed interface inspired by HP Victus styling  
- Includes table viewing using `TableView`

### 📁 File to MySQL and Back
- Basic CLI app to store file contents into MySQL and retrieve them back  
- Uses `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`, and JDBC  
- Good for learning simple text-DB syncing
